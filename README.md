EasySpawn
=========

EasySpawn is a simple plugin, providing two commands; /spawn and /setspawn.
These will set the spawn location for that world only.
So, you can set different spawn locations for different worlds.
Players can do /spawn to get to the set spawn point, and administrators can do /setspawn for world management.

Usage
------
/spawn

	Teleports player to spawn.

/setspawn

	Sets spawn location.

Permissions
-----------

/spawn

	easyspawn.spawn

	by default this works for non-opped players 

/setspawn

	easyspawn.setspawn
	
	works if opped
